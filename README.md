# CustomLeveling-
This plugin is all about implementing a simple way to have custom levels on your server. It allows you to enter a level and how much xp it will take to get there. The best part? The xp bar correctly displays the user's xp level! You can check out the plugin over at bukkit: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/customleveling/
